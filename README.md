This is a game I created in the aim to learn how to cod with PyGame.

The game is a basic platformer where the two main goals are to:

1. Survive from the enemies
  
2. Collect the coins for extra points

Both of these will increase the players score.

Every 50 points, the difficulty level will increase, changing the enemies that are present at that time.

Coins add 3 points to the players score.

All graphics were done by me in photoshop, they are all very simple as graphic design was not the motivation for this game.

## Controls


:arrow_left: and :arrow_right: : Moves player left and right

**Space** : Jump

:arrow_down: : Moves player back to the ground


## What I've learnt
- Register player inputs to move character around the game
- Detect object collisions 
- Have a start screen 
- Create a gravity effect on the player with the ground

## What I would still like to learn
- Add sounds or Music to the game
- Have this game run on a website / web app
- Have a leaderboard the has memory of previous runtimes
